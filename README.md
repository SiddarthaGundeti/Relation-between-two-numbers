# Relation-between-two-numbers

Input:  3 4

Output: A < B

Question Explanation:

The program is tasked with determining and printing the relationship between two integers, A and B. This involves checking if A is equal to, greater than, or less than B.

Logical Approach:

Read Input:
Read the first integer A and the second integer B from user input.

Check if A and B are Equal:
Use an if statement to check if A is equal to B.
If they are equal, print A == B.

Check if A is Greater Than B:
Use an elif (else if) statement to check if A is greater than B.
If A is greater, print A > B.

Check if A is Less Than B:
As a final condition, use an else statement to cover the scenario where A is less than B.
In this case, print A < B.

Output:
Depending on the comparison, the program outputs one of the three possible relations (A == B, A > B, or A < B).

Example for Clarity:

Given A = 3 and B = 4:
As A (3) is less than B (4), the output should be A < B.

The output will be: A < B
